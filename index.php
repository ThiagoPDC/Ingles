                    The objective of the Computer Engineering course is to train professionals who are fully qualified to carry out activities 
                    related to interface areas between electrical engineering and computer science. Accompanying the rapid changes observed in
                    various sectors of economic activity, students are offered, through complementary disciplines, emphasis on improving their 
                    professional profile in embedded systems, communications systems and mobile computing, advanced computing systems and robotics. 
                    The proposal contemplates a differentiated profile in relation to several computer engineering courses already implemented in the 
                    country and makes use of the wide pedagogical, scientific and technological experience of EESC and ICMC.

                <p class="normal-text m-2">
                    Boards and circuits will be your companions on this journey. Disciplines such as electrical and electronics, chemistry and 
                    physics will also be present. It is also possible to specialize in emphases such as robotics and embedded systems. For 
                    example, inside a car there is a system that controls it, an embedded system, which is present in almost all the machines that 
                    we use in our daily lives, such as home appliances.

                    The curricular matrix has a basic core made up of a group of disciplines that bring together physics, mathematics, chemistry, 
                    humanities, administration and economics. The professional core provides a profile strongly based on electronic engineering, 
                    computing and interface areas, and encompasses content from the areas of: digital signal processing, microelectronics (analog 
                    and digital integrated circuit design), digital circuits, robotics and automation, telecommunications , software engineering, distributed 
                    computing systems, computer graphics, database, hypermedia and multimedia, mathematical programming. The core of specialization is made up 
                    of a set of subjects of free choice, comprising the following emphases: embedded systems, communications systems and mobile computing, 
                    advanced computing systems and robotics.

                <p class="normal-text m-2">
                    By graduating in Computer Engineering, you will be able to design digital, computerized systems and even robots. Another 
                    possibility is to manage computer networks in large companies and provide assistance to them, or develop applications and 
                    also work in the field of industrial automation. The areas of expertise are situated at the scientific and technological 
                    interface between electrical/electronic engineering and computer science. You will be able to work in areas of electronic 
                    engineering, computing, telecommunications, microelectronics, automation, information technology, voice, sound and image 
                    processing, artificial intelligence, robotics, software engineering, computer networks, distributed computing systems, 
                    parallel computing and high performance, database and computer-aided tools. The computer engineer stands out for his 
                    versatility combined with his technical-scientific knowledge: it is not enough to know a certain subject well, it is 
                    necessary to know how to transmit it and how to apply it in solving problems. He is able to operate in several segments and 
                    this forces a constant search for technical-scientific updating. The versatility of the training allows the computer engineer 
                    to work both in hardware and software, which makes him a highly sought after professional by the market. The market, in general, 
                    recognizes the value of the computer engineer, which is reflected in a natural rise in the career.
